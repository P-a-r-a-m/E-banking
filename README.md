E-Banking App User Research and Prototype Development
Phase I - User Research
Problem Statement
Our study aims to understand users' perceptions and experiences regarding payment apps. We seek to:

Identify challenges users face
Gauge satisfaction levels
Pinpoint areas for improvement in existing e-banking platforms
Additionally, we aim to investigate users' preferences for online transactions, their app usage patterns, preferred features, types of businesses they engage with using these apps, and the problems they encounter while using them.

Experiment / Study Conducted
We used both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how people use e-banking apps and websites.

Google Form Survey
Created to gather quantitative data
Structured questions on user satisfaction, ease of use, feature preferences, and security concerns
Enabled statistical analysis and complemented qualitative findings from interviews
User Interviews
Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants
Conducted in person or remotely
Provided qualitative insights into user experiences and preferences
Offered specific feedback on e-banking apps
Enhanced understanding beyond quantitative data alone
Findings
Please refer to the attached user research report for detailed findings.

Conclusion
The study on e-banking apps, conducted through Google Form surveys and user interviews, reveals the following key points:

The majority of participants, especially students, use these platforms daily for tasks like bill payments and money transfers due to their convenience and security.
Users generally find e-banking apps easy to navigate, but technical issues such as transaction delays pose challenges, particularly with Google Pay.
Most users express satisfaction with the security measures implemented.
Younger users are more engaged with rewards/offers, while privacy concerns exist, primarily due to incidents like Paytm wallet closures.
Improvement suggestions include simpler interfaces and better customer support.
Overall, the study underscores the increasing significance of e-banking apps in the digital landscape and emphasizes the importance of continuous enhancement to meet user expectations effectively.

Phase II - Prototype
Identified Problems
Complexity of Interface: Too many buttons and options on the main screen leading to confusion and frustration among the users.
Accessibility: Difficulties in accessing some important and commonly used features.
Proposed Solutions
Developed a paper prototype based on user research and findings.
Transitioned from the paper prototype to a Figma prototype.
Improvements in the Figma Prototype:
Simplified user interface
Easy navigation for frequently used features
Added features to enhance user experience
